# AirHeaterCC compatible diesel heater integration for ESPHome

This project provides a configuration for interacting with the AirHeaterCC compatible diesel heater via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). If our control app looks like this, this ESPHome configuration is compatible.

## Compatible devices
### Replacement mainboard + screen with bluetooth
I bought this for my non-bluetooth generic diesel heater to remotely control the device.
This combo costs 25$ in the time writing. You can order it here https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c43EzjEX if you want to add bluetooth communication to your existing diesel heater.

## Important Note
This project is created for educational purposes and automation of the diesel air heater. Use the software at your own risk. The author is not responsible for any damage resulting from the use of the code.
