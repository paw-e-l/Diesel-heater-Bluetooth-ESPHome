I bought this for my non-bluetooth generic diesel heater to remotely control the device.
This combo costs 25$ in the time of writing. You can order it here https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c43EzjEX if you want to add bluetooth communication to your existing diesel heater.

## Important Note
This project is created for educational purposes and automation of the diesel air heater. Use the software at your own risk. The author is not responsible for any damage resulting from the use of the code.
